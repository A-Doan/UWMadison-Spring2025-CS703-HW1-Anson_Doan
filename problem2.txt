1. Satisfiable on any non-empty set with f as the identity function and y=x.
2. Not satisfiable since it requires that f(x) equals every possible y, which is impossible.
3. Satisfiable on any non-empty set with the function f(x,z)=z and z=y.
4. Satisfiable on any non-empty set with f as the identity function.
5. Not satisfiable since string concatenation is not commutative.
