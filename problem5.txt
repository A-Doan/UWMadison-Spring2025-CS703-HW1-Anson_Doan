For each node i, let a_i and b_i represent the start and end point, respectively, for that node's interval.
For all a_i and b_i, a_i < b_i.
For each edge (x, y) where x and y are nodes on the graph, the following must be true:
(a_x < b_x < a_y) or (b_x < a_x < b_y)
For each pair of nodes (p, q) where p and q are not adjacent, the following must be true:
(b_p < a_q) or (b_q < a_p)
