a.
Let P_ic be a boolean variable that is true if node i is assigned color c, and false otherwise.
For each node i, the following constraints are true:
(P_i0 or P_i1 or P_i2)
not (P_i0 and P_i1)
not (P_i0 and P_i2)
not (P_i1 and P_i2)

For each edge (x,y) where x and y are nodes in the graph, the following constraints are true:
not (P_x0 and P_y0)
not (P_x1 and P_y1)
not (P_x2 and P_y2)

At a high level, each node has only one color and for every edge, the two connected nodes do not have the same color.
